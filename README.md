# Atliq Grands - Business and Data Intelligence

## Project Overview
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Recently, they have faced challenges in retaining their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making within the management.

In response, the Managing Director of Atliq Grands decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence into their operations to regain market share and increase revenue. However, Atliq Grands does not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights. As a result, they hired a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and offer actionable insights.

The goal of this project is to provide actionable business insights to the Revenue Management team in the hospitality domain by utilizing historical data provided.
